# Models

This folder defines the Sequelize models that represent database tables.

## Responsibilities
- Define schema (columns, types, constraints).
- Set up relationships (associations).
- Sync schema with the database (if required).

## Best Practices
- Keep each model in a separate file.
- Do not include any business logic here.
