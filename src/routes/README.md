# Routes

This folder defines API route declarations and mapping.

## Responsibilities
- Connect URL endpoints to controller functions.
- Group routes by resource or feature.

## Structure Example
```
    routes/
    ├── user.routes.js
    └── admin.routes.js
```

## Best Practices
- Keep routes declarative and minimal.
- Avoid logic in route files.
